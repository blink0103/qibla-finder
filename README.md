# Qibla Finder
## An interactive qibla finder using Google Maps

Not that there was much of a real need for this as there are several such
websites out there as is, but I wanted to try my hand at this personally.
Just clone the repository and open up qibla.html locally. The qibla calculation
details come from the paper *The Correct Qibla* by S. Kamal Abdali, which can
be found here:
